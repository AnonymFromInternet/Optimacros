# This App is the solution for the task of Optimacros

Another Apps currently under development: with [React](https://github.com/AnonymFromInternet/Conduit), [Angular](https://github.com/AnonymFromInternet/Service) ang [Go](https://github.com/AnonymFromInternet/Hotel)

Uses:
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [Uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)

#### In this App to avoid legacy code I used Redux-Toolkit rather than MobX because I didn't work with this library yet. If this library is used in your company I can learn it by the work. Also, unfortunately I cannot create a functionality for moving items from one tree to another.
